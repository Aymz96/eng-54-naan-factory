# TDD Naan Factory Exercise :taco:

This exercise is going to bring together lots of concepts.

### Learning Outocomes
Learning outcomes include:
- git
- github
- functions
- TDD 
- separation of concerns
- DRY code
- DOD


## Intalling and running
To run the naan factory do the following: 

```python
import naan_factory
run_factory()
```


### TDD - test driven development

1. write the test
2. run it, and read the error
3. code and make it pass the test

this helps with: 
- Stop over engineering
- Maintainable code 
- Reduce technical debt
- Goes well with agile and working code
- errors can be your guide in complex systems

How it works is that we write unit tests. 

##### Unit Tests

Test single pieces of code. Like a function. 

**base of a test**
Usually has 3 phases. 
- setup phase (know variables)
- calling of the function / piece of code with know variables 
- asserting for expect output
